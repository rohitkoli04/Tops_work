//What is Normalization
//Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity by organizing tables in a specific way.

//Normalization helps to maintain data integrity by reducing data redundancy, ensuring data consistency, and improving query performance.

//Normalization involves applying a series of normalization rules to eliminate or minimize data anomalies and ensure data consistency.

//The most common normalization forms are 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, and 5NF.
