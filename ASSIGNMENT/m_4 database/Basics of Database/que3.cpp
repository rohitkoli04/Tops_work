//What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

//DBMSs and RDBMSs are both software systems
// used to manage and manipulate databases, but they have different 
//data models, query languages, data storage, data integrity features, scalability capabilities, and ACID compliance


//RDMS specifically, use a relational data model and provide additional 
//features, such as normalization and referential integrity, to improve data
// integrity and query performance
