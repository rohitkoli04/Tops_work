What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?


A DBMS is a software system that manages the storage, organization, and retrieval of data 
in a database. It provides various tools and services to create, manipulate, and maintain databases. 


An RDBMS is a type of DBMS that uses the relational model to organize and store data. The 
relational model is based on the concept of tables, where data is stored in rows and columns.
 RDBMSs provide a set of standard SQL (Structured Query Language) commands to interact with the database.
